Above you will find a collection of scripts I use to manage AAD.

You will notice in some of the scripts, hashes '#####' replace some of the code. This is sensitive information and should be replaced with your own. For information on using the scripts please see comments on individual files.
I am working on converting all sctipts to commandlets, for ease of use.
